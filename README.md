# Caret Implementation for GRF

You can find here a custom implementation of the Generalized Random Forest (https://github.com/swager/grf) for the Caret-Framework. 
By default the grid-search is using the output from ´tune_regression_forest()´ and the random search takes the output of tune_regression_forest as starting point. In both cases honest tree splitting is enabled.
Feedback is welcome.
